# Fuzzy_Logic_Controller-for-Air_Conditioner
There is a mounting demand for energy-efficient air conditioning systems in the context of rising global temperatures 
and consumption cuts. Ensuring optimal indoor comfort levels is arduous when operating with rigid control mechanisms in 
conventional air conditioning systems, significantly when outdoor conditions change. In such systems, invariant control 
parameters have limited adaptivity to variations in temperature, humidity, or voltage swings and thus do not guarantee optimal 
operation as consumptions rise. This project deals with an FLC that is to be used in determining optimized values for some key 
parameters, namely the fan and compressor speed ratios in an air conditioner. Hence, the procedure enables the regulation of 
air conditioning performance in a resourceful way with specified inputs. In general, a system employing fuzzy logic shows 
much robustness when environmental conditions vary in nature and uncertainties. The approach focuses on providing a system 
that can adapt to dynamic circumstances without compromising user comfort or energy cost. Compared to traditional systems, 
quantitative analysis demonstrates 20â€“25% energy savings through fan speed modifications and optimum compressor usage.
